### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Lunarax/Lunarax** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
I'm studying Software Engineering in Atilim Universcity/Turkey
I'm learing C++(mostly from my classes) and Python(by myself)
I'm mostly looking for things that can improve my understanding in writing codes 
You can ask me anything you want ofc but i don't think i would have the knowledge to answer it properly for now
